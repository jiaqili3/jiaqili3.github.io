I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen), SDS](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en), supervised by Professor [Zhizheng Wu](https://drwuz.com/). Before that, I received B.S. degree at CUHK-Shenzhen. 

My research interest includes **text-to-speech synthesis** and **neural audio coding**. I am one of the main contributors and leaders of the open-source [Amphion](https://github.com/open-mmlab/Amphion) toolkit. Currently, I am working on open-sourcing a new neural audio codec named DualCodec and some TTS systems using DualCodec.
